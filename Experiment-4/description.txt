Live Character Counter: Test Cases & Styling Guide

1. Character Count Updates
Test Case

This feature displays the number of characters typed in a textarea and updates in real time.

Expected Behavior:

The counter starts at 0 before the user types anything.
Each keystroke (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols) increases the count.
Deleting text decreases the count immediately.

Passes if:

The number updates instantly while typing or deleting.
The displayed count matches the actual number of characters in the textarea.

Fails if:

The counter doesn’t update in real time.
The number displayed does not match the actual number of characters entered.

2. Placeholder & Initial State

Test Case
The textarea should provide guidance with a placeholder message, and the counter should show zero initially.

Expected Behavior:

Placeholder text "Start typing..." is visible when the textarea is empty.
Character count is 0 before the user types.

Passes if:

The placeholder disappears as soon as the user starts typing.
The counter begins at zero on page load.

Fails if:

The placeholder is missing or doesn’t clear after typing starts.
The counter shows a non-zero value before typing.

3. Layout & Styling
Test Case

The feature should be neatly styled and easy to use.

Layout Structure:

Heading: "Live Character Counter" displayed above the textarea.
Textarea: Expands to full width with a fixed height.
Counter: Positioned below the textarea, bold text, showing "Characters: X".

Passes if:

The counter is aligned properly under the textarea.
Textarea is large enough for comfortable typing.
Styling remains consistent across different screen sizes.

Fails if:

The counter overlaps with the textarea.
Elements are misaligned or cut off on resizing.

4. Accessibility
Test Case

The component should be easy for all users to interact with.

Passes if:

The placeholder provides clear instructions.
Counter text is readable and not too small.

Works smoothly across common browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

Fails if:

The placeholder is unclear or missing.
Counter text is too small or blends into the background.
