Dynamic Product Filter with Dropdown: Test Cases & Styling Guide
This document outlines the functionality, expected behavior, and styling approach for the Dynamic Product Filter feature.

1. Dropdown Filtering
Test Case

The dropdown allows users to filter products by category: All, Clothing, Electronics, Books.
Expected Behavior (All Selected):

All products are displayed in a vertical list.
Expected Behavior (Specific Category Selected):

Only products that belong to the chosen category are displayed.

Passes if:

Selecting a category instantly updates the product list.
The products shown exactly match the selected category.

Fails if:

Filtering does not happen in real time.
Wrong products appear or disappear incorrectly.

2. Initial State
Test Case

When the page loads, the dropdown should be set to All, showing all available products.

Passes if:

Dropdown shows All on page load.
All products (Clothing, Electronics, Books) are visible.

Fails if:

The dropdown defaults to a specific category.
Some products are hidden before any selection is made.

3. Layout & Responsiveness
Test Case

The product list and dropdown should be clearly structured inside a styled container.

Layout Structure:

Heading: "Product List" at the top.

Dropdown Menu: Below heading, labeled Filter by Category.

Product List: Each product displayed as a separate row inside a bordered box.

Passes if:

Dropdown and products are aligned neatly.
Each product appears in its own row.
Layout remains consistent when resizing the browser window.

Fails if:

Products overlap or appear inline instead of block rows.
Container breaks when resizing.

4. User Interaction
Test Case

Filtering must be seamless and user-friendly.

Passes if:

Selecting a new category instantly hides irrelevant products.
Dropdown interaction feels smooth with no reloads.

Fails if:

User has to refresh the page to see filtered results.
Dropdown selection causes layout glitches.
